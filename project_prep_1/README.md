## Conflict Plan

What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?

Identifying the source of the issue and attempting to resolve any misunderstandings.

What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?

This makes it difficult to learn from others, which is a terrible thing. We begin by guiding the individual and informing him of the flaws in his behavior.

How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?

Individual talents vary, which is to be expected; nevertheless, learning and follow-up fill in the gaps, forming new bonds between teammates and assisting in the development of communication skills.

How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?

Encourage them to give it their best shot. There's nothing wrong with attempting new things and learning from your failures. The incentive is to establish and develop small activities, which helps to restore a person's excitement and prevents them from feeling isolated from the team or underestimating their own skills.

How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?

I can't help but inform lead instructor after exhausting all possible options to bring the person back on track.
